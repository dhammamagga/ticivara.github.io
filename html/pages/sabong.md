# Sabong Sewing Guide

Determine the final size and mark the cloth.

If the cloth is not tall enough to draw the sabong as one piece, divide at the
khandha lines as necessary and draw the khandhas horizontally on the cloth.

Allow 1cm cutting buffers at the side edges where khandhas will be joined, and
5-10cm shifting buffers at the top and bottom edge of the khandhas.

Fold and make the first sewing. Observe the sequence of the lines: (1) broken,
(2) cross, (3) long. The second sewing is in the same sequence.

FIGURE: sewing sequence

If the cloth was cut as one pieces, it is ready for the second sewing.

If it was cut from separate pieces, these will have to be joined now.

The join has to hide both edges and the resulting kusi has to be lower than the
mandala.

FIGURE: joining khandha edges

In the second sewing, the folding direction has to be observed so that the kusis
are lower than the mandalas.

When looking at the outside of the result, only one line of sewing should be seen.

Make a hem around the edges at 1cm.
