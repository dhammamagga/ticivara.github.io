# Borders

Find the distance at which the joined khandhas can be cut.

Take the line of the kusis and measure which edge is the closest. Draw that
line.

Keep in mind that 1cm will be taken up by he hem for the border.

The drawn area is the available maximum size for the robe. If this is larger
than desired, measure back from the edges evenly and draw the lines for an even
size.

Trim all around.

Examine both sides of the cloth for any defects and choose which side is better.
That will be outside, the borders will be placed there.

Place the cloth on the ironing board with the outside up. Fold up 1cm, iron the
edge by tapping with the iron, and pin it as you go all around the cloth.

Spread the cloth on the floor with the outside up and place the borders along
the edge. Pin it and sew both sides to about 30cm distance from the corners, so
that the ends at the corners are free to manipulate.

After sewing, arrange one corner on the ironing board and iron the edges flat.
Take care that the edges should meet at the exact corner of the main cloth.

Draw the diagonal on both border layers.

Fold them in along the diagonal. The flaps should be folded inside.

Take care to align the corner of the two borders, the corner of the main cloth
and the end of the diagonal mark.

Fold out on border, measure 1.5cm from the diagonal on the flap and trim.

Fold out both borders and arrange one on top of the other and pin it.

Trim the other flap as well.

Cut off the edge corners at a lower than 45 degree angle to not let loose edges
protrude on the sides. Trim any small irregularities which may protrude.

Fold back on the corner, arrange the edges and corners carefully and pin them.

First sew the inner edges, up to the inner corner, then across the diagonal, then
down along the diagonal on the other side and off the corner.

Then sew the outer edge.

Repeat with the other corners and the border is finished.
